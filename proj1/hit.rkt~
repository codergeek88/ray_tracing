(define-type Parity (U 'IN 'OUT))

;; A (Hit ...) records an intersection (aka "hit") between a Ray R
;; and an object.

;; <HIT FUNCTIONS GO HERE>

;; a Hit-List is a list of Hit records sorted by increasing t value that
;; describes how a ray interacts with an object.  We require that the parities
;; of adjacent hits be opposite.  In other words, a ray cannot leave (resp. enter)
;; the object unless it is inside (resp. outside) the object.
;;
(define-type Hit-List (Listof Hit))

;; We use the empty list to represent a miss
;;
(define miss : Hit-List '())

;; <HIT-LIST FUNCTIONS GO HERE>

;; ==== Testing support ====

(: valid-hit-list? : Hit-List -> Boolean)
;; test that a hit list is valid.  I.e., that its t values are increasing and
;; that parities alternate.  This function can be used to check the correctness
;; of other functions, but otherwise does no useful work.
(define (valid-hit-list? hits)
  (local
    {(: checker : Parity Real Hit-List -> Boolean)
     ;; check the hits, where p1 is the parity and t1 is the t value of the
     ;; preceeding hit
     (define (checker p1 t1 hits)
       (match hits
         [(cons (Hit p2 t2 _ _ _) hitr)
          (and (<= t1 t2) (not (symbol=? p1 p2)) (checker p2 t2 hitr))]
         ['() #t]))}
    (match hits
      [(cons (Hit p t _ _ _) hitr) (checker p t hitr)]
      ['() #t])))

;; A (Hit-Info ...) struct records the geometric information about a
;; hit record.  This structure can be used to implement check-within
;; tests, since it does not involve materials, which cannot be compared.
(define-struct Hit-Info
  ([parity : Parity]        ;; specifies if the hit is an entry or exit
   [t : Float]              ;; value of t such that R(t) is the point
                            ;; where the ray R intersects the object
   [pt : Float3]            ;; The point of intersection (i.e., R(t))
   [norm : Float3]))        ;; Unit-length normal vector at pt

(: hit->info : Hit -> Hit-Info)
